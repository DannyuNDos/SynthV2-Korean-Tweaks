# SynthV2-Korean-Tweaks
A script for aiding SynthV 2's Korean pronunciation.

## How to use

### Installation
Copy the `KoreanTweaks.js` file into SynthV 2's scripts folder, as viewable in `Scripts > Open Scripts Folder`.

**Be sure to save the file in UTF-8 format.**

### Execution
In the SynthV Studio, select the notes that has Korean lyrics written in Hangul, then execute `Scripts > Unofficial language support > Korean Tweaks` in the menu. If this doesn't appear in the menu, execute `Scripts > Rescan`, and try again.

## Caveats
You need SynthV Studio 2 Pro to use this script.

This script works only for Hangul lyrics.

This script borrows Mandarin phonemes to aid the Korean pronunciation.

The options to tweak vowels override the "mouth opening" parameter.

This script is guaranteed to work on only the standalone version of SynthV Studio 2. On the VSTi version, this script may suffer from compatibility issues.
