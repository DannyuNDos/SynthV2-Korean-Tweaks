# SynthV2-Korean-Tweaks
A script for aiding SynthV 2's Korean pronunciation.

## How to use

### Installation
Copy the attached JavaScript file to the `scripts` folder, as accessible by executing `Scripts > Open Scripts Folder` in the menu of SynthV.

**Be sure to save the file in UTF-8 format.**

### Execution
In the SynthV Studio, select the notes that has Korean lyrics written in Hangul, then press the button in `Korean Tweaks` sub-panel in the scripts panel. If this doesn't appear in the script panel, execute `Scripts > Rescan` in the menu bar, and try again.

The pronunciation issues that this script fixes include:
* Sandhi
* Codas ㄱ/ㄷ/ㅂ
* Palatalization of ㅅ/ㅆ
* Pronunciation of ㅟ
* Distinction of ㅐ/ㅔ

This script also offers an option for the North Korean pronunciation, specifically for the de-palatalized ㅈ/ㅉ/ㅊ.

## Caveats
You need SynthV Studio 2 with the version of at least 2.1.2 to use this script.

This script works only for Hangul lyrics.

This script borrows Mandarin phonemes and English phonemes to aid the Korean pronunciation.

This script is guaranteed to work on only the standalone version of SynthV Studio 2. On the VSTi version, this script may suffer from compatibility issues.
